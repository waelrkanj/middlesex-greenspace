## Middlesex County Open Space Accessibility

The research is clear that access to open and green space plays <a href="https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2022/04/parks-green-spaces-improve-health"> a key role in a person's overall wellbeing.</a> New Jersey has a wealth of open and green spaces available for residents to spend time in and engage with. But access to these sites isn't distributed equally across the state and throughout municipalities. Some places and some people can more easily access the state's green spaces. This map explores that dynamic for municipalities in Middlesex County, located in Central New Jersey (yes, it exists!)

The data in the interactive map below is based on accessibility in two dimensions - the percent of the municipality which is designated as green space, and the percent of the municipality's population which lives within 1/4 mile of any green space. 

In addition to the level of accessibility, there is also the question of how access to green space varies across sociodemographic factors. The two maps below show green spaces throughout the county in relation to two Census variables mapped by Block Groups - income and race. Most of the county's larger green spaces are spread throughout the southern part of the county, where the population tends to be whiter and higher-income. While residents in the denser, lower-income areas in the north might live close to open spaces, those also tend to be smaller parks, suggesting that each municipality needs to do their own work to ensure equitable access to green space for their residents.
